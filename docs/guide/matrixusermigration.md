# Matrix User Migration

This short guide explains how to migrate a Matrix user when changing home servers. Generally, users within the Matrix ecosystem have unique ID's, consisting of a username and a home server: `@username:home.server.domain`. As such, migrating from the home server `home.server.domain` to `home.server.new` requires the creation of the **new and unique** user `@username:home.server.new`. Note, that any new user name might be chosen.
